# Whats available in this assessment
There are 3 Notebook files in this repository(under notebook) each file showing us how model training works and evaluating these models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. These files are labeled according to what has been discussed.
1. Basic.ipynb            - this is a model training for processed data.
2. Data Processing.ipynb  - this demonstrates unprocessed data converted into processed data then model training is performed.
3. Unprocessed data.ipynb - this is to demonstrate what will happen if you do not process the data and train the model regardless.
